#Climate data for historic stations
Monthly data are available for a selection of long-running historic stations. The series typically range from 50 to more than 100 years in length.

#Our historic station data consists of:

Mean daily maximum temperature (tmax)
Mean daily minimum temperature (tmin)
Days of air frost (af)
Total rainfall (rain)
Total sunshine duration (sun)
Monthly mean temperature
The monthly mean temperature is calculated from the average of the mean daily maximum and mean daily minimum temperature i.e. (tmax+tmin)/2.
